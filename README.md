# Scala Learning Scripts

This repository serves as a personal collection of Scala scripts developed during my journey of learning the Scala programming language. It contains various examples, exercises, and small projects designed to solidify understanding of Scala's features, paradigms, and libraries.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

*   **Organize Learning Materials:** Centralize all Scala-related code written for educational purposes.
*   **Track Progress:** Provide a chronological record of my learning path in Scala.
*   **Reference Code:** Offer readily available examples for future reference and review.
*   **Experimentation Ground:** Serve as a sandbox for trying out new Scala concepts and syntax.

## Contents

The scripts are typically organized by topic or concept, reflecting the progression of my learning. You might find examples covering:

*   **Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data types, control flow.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, traits, inheritance.
*   **Functional Programming (FP):** Immutability, higher-order functions, pattern matching, collections.
*   **Concurrency:** Futures, Akka (if explored).
*   **Build Tools:** SBT configurations (if applicable).
*   **Specific Libraries/Frameworks:** Examples demonstrating usage of particular Scala libraries.

## How to Use

To explore or run these scripts:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
